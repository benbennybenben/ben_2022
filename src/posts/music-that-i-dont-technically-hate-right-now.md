## Most Music is rubbish

I've not enjoyed listening to new music for a long time. It all sounds like bad remakes of the bands I listened to when I was a kid. It makes sense though, people the same as me listened to the same music growing up and that made them want to to make music themselves. No harm in that, it's just that I don't like what those people are making because it sounds like what I've already heard.

### Cat thing goes here

## {% cat "Bem", "Gregory" %}

{% include '../_includes/partials/cat.html' %}

```
this is some code
